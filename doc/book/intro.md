# Introduction

`Zend\Barcode\Barcode` provides a generic way to generate barcodes. The
`Zend\Barcode` component is divided into two subcomponents: barcode objects and
renderers. *Objects* allow you to create barcodes independently of the renderer.
*Renderers* allow you to draw barcodes based on the target output.
